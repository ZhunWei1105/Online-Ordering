# Online-Ordering
There are two files. src file is about the front-end and the onlineOrder file is about the backend.
We implemented Rest API via Spring MVC including registration, menu searching and ordering, checkout, etc.
We utilized Hibernate to access and manipulate the data storage (menu, restaurants etc.).
We provided both authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from attacks.
We used the Spring framework core technologies to loosely decouple all the components in the application.
We built the client side with ReactJS and Ant Design to allow users to add items to shopping carts.
